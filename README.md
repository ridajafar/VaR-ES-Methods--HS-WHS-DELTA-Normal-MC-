# VaR-ES-Methods-HS-WHS-DELTA-Normal-MC-


"This repository is dedicated to a series of finance exercises and case studies, implemented using Python. Here's an overview of the included content:

0. **Exercise: Variance-Covariance Method for VaR & ES in a Linear Portfolio**
   - Calculate daily Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for an equally weighted equity portfolio consisting of Adidas, Allianz, Munich Re, and L’Oréal as of March 20, 2019.
   - Utilize a Gaussian parametric approach with a 3-year estimation and a €10 million notional portfolio.

1. **Case Study: Historical (HS & WHS) Simulation, Bootstrap, and PCA for VaR & ES in a Linear Portfolio**
   - Evaluate risk measures for three distinct portfolios using various methods:
     A. Historical Simulation and Bootstrap for Portfolio 1.
     B. Weighted Historical Simulation for Portfolio 2.
     C. Gaussian parametric PCA for Portfolio 3 with different principal components (n=1 to 6).

2. **Exercise: Full Monte-Carlo and Delta Normal VaR**
   - Calculate a 10-day/99% Value-at-Risk (VaR) for a portfolio comprising Vonovia stocks and put options with different approaches: Full Monte-Carlo and Delta Normal (only delta term).
   - Implement a 2-year Historical Simulation for the underlying.
   - Explore potential improvements for the Delta Normal VaR and discuss the numerical intensity of Full Monte-Carlo for exotic derivatives without closed-form pricing.

3. **Case Study: Pricing in Presence of Counterparty Risk**
   - Address a scenario where bank XX purchases a 4-year Cliquet option from ISP with specific terms.
   - Determine the correct price for the option and analyze the potential selling price from ISP's perspective.

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for financial analysis and modeling, covering a range of topics from risk assessment to derivative pricing and counterparty risk considerations."
